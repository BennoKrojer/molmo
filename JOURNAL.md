## 2024-12

### 2024-12-30
- **BUG FOUND**: `run_all_missing.sh` only ran layer 0 for NN/LogitLens (`LAYERS="0"`). Ablation data is incomplete:
  - LogitLens: only layer 0 exists for all ablations
  - NN: inconsistent legacy data (some have random layers like 12, 20, 28 from old experiments)
  - Expected: layers 0,1,2,4,8,16,24,30,31 (9 layers) for OLMo ablations
- Added rule to .cursorrules/CLAUDE.md: "ALWAYS flag inconsistencies and investigate"
- **Git push**: "Add ablation viewer system and Qwen2-VL analysis scripts" (191 files, 52k+ insertions)
- Created bulletproof viewer management system:
  - `scripts/analysis/viewer_models.json` - config file for all models
  - `scripts/analysis/add_models_to_viewer.py` - validates data, updates index
  - `scripts/analysis/generate_ablation_viewers.py` - generates ablation viewers
- Generated 10 ablation viewers with 10 images each:
  - Qwen2-VL (off-the-shelf): NN=9, LogitLens=9, Contextual=9 layers
  - Seed 10, Seed 11: NN=3, LogitLens=1, Contextual=9 layers
  - Linear Connector: NN=4, LogitLens=1, Contextual=9 layers
  - Unfreeze LLM: NN=15, LogitLens=1, Contextual=9 layers
  - First-Sentence: NN=14, LogitLens=1, Contextual=9 layers
  - Earlier ViT (6, 10): NN=1, LogitLens=1, Contextual=9 layers
  - TopBottom variants: NN=1, LogitLens=1, Contextual=9 layers
- Updated README.md, .cursorrules, CLAUDE.md with new scripts and git workflow
- Created JOURNAL.md for change tracking

### 2024-12-29
- Created `run_all_missing.sh` master script for ablation analysis pipeline
- Added Qwen2-VL support for static NN and LogitLens
- LLM Judge evaluation running for contextual NN ablations

### 2024-12-23
- Initial unified viewer with 9 main models working
- Qwen2-VL contextual NN integration
