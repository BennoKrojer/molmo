[2026-01-11 15:38:31] Next steps:
[2026-01-11 15:38:31] 1. Check for failures: grep -i 'failed\|error' logs/rerun_contextual_20260111_153831/*.log
[2026-01-11 15:38:31] 2. Count results:
[2026-01-11 15:38:31]    ls analysis_results/llm_judge_contextual_nn/*.json 2>/dev/null | wc -l
[2026-01-11 15:38:31]    ls analysis_results/llm_judge_contextual_nn/ablations/ | wc -l
[2026-01-11 15:38:31] 3. Regenerate plots with updated data
